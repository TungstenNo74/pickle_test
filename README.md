#Pickles!!!

Well, here goes nothing.

This will be a very boring repo by the way, just a way for me to play with saving/retrieving files.

So, this works just fine.  You can change the file name and extension.

No saving classes here, so you're going to need to load dictionaries and arrays into the file.  Shouldn't be too hard.
